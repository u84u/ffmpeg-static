### FFMPEG-static

A work in construction for a fully static build of ffmpeg with all de/encoders, hardware accelerators, de/muxers, parsers, protocols, bitstream filters, in/outdevs, filters enabled with everything enabled in third party dependencies too.

TODO:
- make a list of all third party libraries that ffmpeg uses and add them as submodules
- find all the third-third party libraries that they use recursively
- build the last 7.X version as a test
